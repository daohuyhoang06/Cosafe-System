            <p>
                The EWG VERIFIED<sup>®</sup> mark on a product indicates that the product meets EWG’s strictest standards for transparency and health.

            <ul class="checklist">
                <li>
                <strong>✔ Avoids EWG’s Ingredients of concern</strong><br>
                EWG VERIFIED products cannot contain any ingredients on EWG’s “Unacceptable” list, which includes ingredients with health, ecotoxicity and/or contamination concerns.
                </li>
                <li>
                <strong>✔ Full transparency</strong><br>
                EWG VERIFIED products must meet EWG’s standards for ingredient disclosure on the label; products with the VERIFIED mark are made by manufacturers that have been fully transparent with EWG about that product’s ingredients, including fragrance ingredients.
                </li>
                <li>
                <strong>✔ Good manufacturing practices</strong><br>
                EWG VERIFIED product manufacturers must develop and follow current good manufacturing practices to further ensure the safety of their products.

            <h2>Ingredient Concerns</h2>

            <p><strong>Cancer:</strong> Ingredients linked to cancer in government, industry or academic studies or assessments.</p>

            <p><strong>Developmental and reproductive toxicity:</strong> Ingredients linked to developmental and reproductive toxicity, a broad class of health effects that range from infertility and reproductive organ cancers to birth defects and developmental delays in children.</p>

            <p><strong>Allergies and immunotoxicity:</strong> Ingredients linked to harm to the immune system, a class of health problems that manifest as allergic reactions or an impaired capacity to fight disease and repair damaged tissue in the body.</p>

            <p><strong>Use restrictions:</strong> Ingredients restricted or prohibited for use in cosmetics, according to industry safety guidelines, government requirements or guidance from the U.S., EU, Japan or Canada.</p>

            <p><strong>Endocrine disruption:</strong> Ingredients may affect the proper functioning of the body's hormone system.</p>

            <p><strong>Neurotoxicity:</strong> Ingredients linked to harm to the brain and nervous system, a class of health problems that can range from subtle developmental delays to chronic nerve degeneration diseases.</p>

            <p><strong>Organ system toxicity:</strong> Ingredients linked to toxicity of one or more biological systems in the body, for instance, cardiovascular, stomach and digestive track, or respiratory system, through laboratory studies or studies of people.</p>

            <p><strong>Biochemical or cellular level changes:</strong> Ingredients affect the body at a cellular or biochemical level, potentially leading to larger but poorly understood health implications.</p>

            <p><strong>Persistence and bioaccumulation:</strong> Ingredients resist normal breakdown in the environment; build up in wildlife, the food chain, and people; and linger in the body for years or even decades after exposure.</p>

            <p><strong>Ecotoxicity:</strong> Ingredients linked to toxicity of wildlife that may include fish, plants or other wild organisms.</p>

            <p><strong>Irritation:</strong> Ingredients linked to irritation of the skin, eyes or lungs.</p>

            <p><strong>Occupational hazards:</strong> Ingredients linked to hazards for workers exposed on the job, including immediate dangers from chemical handling, or longer-term health effects from routine occupational exposures.</p>

            <p><strong>Enhanced skin absorption:</strong> Ingredients may more readily absorb through the skin due to properties like penetration-enhancing abilities or small particle size, or by virtue of where they are applied on the body (on infant skin, or on lips or damaged skin).</p>

            <p><strong>Contamination concerns:</strong> Ingredients may be contaminated with toxic impurities, many of which are linked to cancer, according to government and cosmetic industry ingredient safety assessments or peer-reviewed studies.</p>
